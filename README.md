### **Data Loading and Cleaning**
- The dataset is loaded from a CSV file, which contains historical stock prices. Before processing the data, any missing values are handled using forward-fill, ensuring that the dataset is complete for training.

### **Data Preprocessing**
- The "Open" stock prices are extracted as the input feature for the model. The data is then reshaped into a format suitable for scaling. A `MinMaxScaler` is applied to normalize the stock prices between 0 and 1, which helps the model train more efficiently and avoid issues with large values.

### **Sequence Creation**
- To predict future stock prices, a rolling window of 30 consecutive days is used to create sequences. Each sequence of 30 days of stock prices becomes the input (`x_stock`), while the stock price of the next day becomes the output (`y_stock`). This structure helps the LSTM model learn from patterns over time.

### **LSTM Model Architecture**
- The LSTM model is constructed using two LSTM layers. The first LSTM layer has 50 units and returns sequences (necessary for stacking multiple LSTM layers). A dropout layer is added to prevent overfitting. The second LSTM layer has 20 units and does not return sequences. The output layer is a fully connected dense layer with a single neuron to predict the stock price for the next day.

### **Model Compilation and Training**
- The model is compiled with the `Adam` optimizer and uses `mean squared error` as the loss function, which is common for regression tasks. The model is trained on the prepared sequences for 30 epochs.

### **Making Predictions**
- After training, the model is used to predict the stock prices on the training data. The predicted values are then converted back to the original scale using inverse transformation. These predictions are plotted alongside the actual stock prices to visually compare the model’s accuracy.

### **Future Predictions**
- The model is also used to forecast future stock prices. The last 30 days of the dataset are used as input to predict the next day’s stock price. This process is repeated to predict stock prices for the next 10 days. The predicted values are then transformed back to their original scale and displayed.

### **Conclusion**
- The code builds a robust LSTM model that leverages past stock prices to predict future values. It handles missing data, scales input, creates time-based sequences, and makes predictions that can be compared to actual values for validation. Additionally, the model can be used to forecast stock prices for future dates, making it useful for time-series prediction tasks.
